# Phish Guard   

Welcome to the Malicious URL Detection Bot, Phish Guard, a cutting-edge WhatsApp-based chatbot created as part of the GDSC Hackin Winters 2025 Hackathon. This project introduces a robust, user-friendly system for identifying and mitigating threats posed by malicious URLs. It combines the power of APIs, Python, and browser extension technologies to protect users from phishing and fraudulent websites.  
**The browser extension** complements the WhatsApp bot by providing an additional layer of security during web browsing. It automatically monitors malicious URLs using a predefined, developer-provided list.

##  **About the Project**  

The **Malicious URL Detection Bot: Phish Guard** allows users to send a URL to the bot via WhatsApp. The bot processes the URL and determines its safety using:  
- **Threat intelligence APIs** (e.g., VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing).  
- **Custom algorithms** that analyze patterns in the URL.  
- Replies instantly with a detailed report on the URL's status.  

**Browser Extension for URL Safety**  
The browser extension complements and enhances the usability of the WhatsApp-based Malicious URL Detection Bot by extending its functionality across multiple platforms, such as web browsers, emails, and other online services. It acts as a proactive layer of defense, providing real-time URL safety checks as users navigate the internet, ensuring comprehensive protection beyond WhatsApp.
